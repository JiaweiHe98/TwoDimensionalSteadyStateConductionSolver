# TwoDimensionalSteadyStateConductionSolver
This project is aimed at solving the steady-state heat conduction problem in a two-dimensional domain through a numerical method.

## What is heat conduction?
When it comes to the word conduction, we might immediately come with some stuffs about electricity, like a conductor or current.  Generally, a metal wire can conduct electricity because it contains free electron. The “force” that pushes the current is simply voltage. However, when it comes to heat conduction, things are getting more complicated. Similarly, the “force” of heat conduction is the temperature difference. Differently, there is no directional flow of particles in conduction when the heat goes from one place to another. It is just the flow of energy, and the energy flow is coursed by the atoms colliding and hitting on a molecular scale.

A temperature difference exists between the tip and the tail of the iron bar. This temperature difference drives the heat to dissipate.

## Steady State
The definition of a steady state is defined as a condition in a physical process when its states are no longer time dependent.
